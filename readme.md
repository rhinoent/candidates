# Casino Days - Frontend Developer Test – React
_**Clone, complete the following requirements and create a pull request to the original repository.**_

**_Append any extra documentation needed at the end of this file_**

---

Purpose is to build a React Redux application with the dependencies needed to complete the tasks, building the app using the best practices to today’s knowledge, using components etc. Making the app relatively responsive and looking not too bad using a pre-processor for the styling. This to be built using mocked data representing the API. Additionally use unit tests where you see fit.

An app with logged in and logged out state where the user has access to views accordingly, navigating around should change the URL.


### A main navigation in logged out mode containing
- Log in
- Game browser

#### A main navigation in logged in mode containing
- Log out
- Game browser
- Display username
- Settings

#### A content part where the content would be displayed Content views;
- Logged out: game browser with a list of games, where the button to open up a game says “Play for fun”. Default logged out view.
- Logged in: game browser with a list of games, where the button to open up a game says “Play for real”. Default logged in view.
- Logged out: view to play a specific game and a button stating that you need to log in to play for real somewhere in the view
- Logged in: view to play a specific game
- Logged out: Log in
- Logged in: Settings (where the user can change the username, this should update the username displayed in the navigation)

As technology requirements we would like to see you using some of the following:
- React
- Redux
- Webpack
- A CSS pre-processor (ex. SASS)
- Unit Testing
- NodeJS
- WebSockets
- UI framework (ex. Bootstrap)
#### Implementing following technologies will be considered as extra asset:
- Consume any public GraphQL endpoint
- We require the functional requirements to be committed to an online private GIT based repository of your choosing with each functional requirement implemented on a separate feature branch. Once each functional requirement has been implemented and is in working order you can merge them into the “develop” branch and then later merge to the “master” branch once you are ready to submit to us.

While the completion of the entire test is important, showing off your knowledge and understanding good code design practices are more vital.

Please include a README file at the top of GIT repo explaining your code, how to run it and how to execute your unit tests. You should also include a file called ASSUMPTIONS which contains any assumptions you concluded and the reasons behind them.

Once you are ready to submit, please invite [kristina@casinodays.com](mailto:kristina@casinodays.com) and [marco@casinodays.com](mailto:marco@casinodays.com) to your repo, so we can review your code.
